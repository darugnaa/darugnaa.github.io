I've been looking around for blog engines since this summer. I don't like wordpress. Tumblr is a nice platform but too "social" and biased towards image sharing. This Github Pages thing thrilled me for a while and finally I got some time to try it out!

I **love** having just a bunch of static files sitting in some directories. I can edit from any system, using any editor available, and have drafts and changes... living in another branch because it simply a Git repo.

The engine itself is called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). AFAIU it wraps a templating engine which _compiles_ markdown files to static HTML pages. Bells and whistles can be added like they are _source files_. Simply awesome.

# Let's get started
Nice and free theme installed. Content is coming!
