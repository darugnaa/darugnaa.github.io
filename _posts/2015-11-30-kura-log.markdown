Eclipse Kura is an OSGI based framework for "Internet of Things" gateways.
Developing applications that run inside Kura is [pretty easy](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Kura/Getting_Started). But what about debugging? You can [debug remotely] (https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/kura-dev/msg00143.html) from Eclipse IDE, but this is not always possible. What if you are debugging network issues or some strange behaviour which depends on timing?
Usually you write debug statements in your code. Sometimes, however, not all loggers have the desired level or there are too many lines scrolling.

# Change log levels at runtime
Kura actually uses SLF4j and Log4j to implement logging. Log4j allows logging levels to be changed at runtime.

## From command line
Access the OSGi console on a running Kura instance with `telnet <kura-ip-address> 5002` and use the following commands:  
`getkuraloglevels` to list all loggers available and their level  
`setkuraloglevel <loggername> <level>` to set the desired level  
Available levels are **TRACE**, **DEBUG**, **INFO** (default), **WARN**, **ERROR** and **CRITICAL**.

## Using a web browser
Alternatively you can deploy [Kura Web Log](https://github.com/darugnaa/kura-web-log) bundle and then access it from your browser **http:/kura-ip-address/weblog**. You will see all available loggers. Just click the menu and select the new level to be set.  
This way you can get only the relevant output and silence all services that just add noise.
